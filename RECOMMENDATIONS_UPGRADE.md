# Recommendations Upgrade - More Insightful & Personal

## Problem
The original recommendations were generic and not actionable enough:
- "You have 2 benefits in breakdown_cover across AA Membership"
- No clear savings amounts
- No specific next steps
- Lacked personality and urgency

## Solution
Enhanced GPT prompts and UI to provide:

### 1. **More Personalized Insights**

**Before:**
```
Title: "Duplicate breakdown_cover Benefits"
Rationale: "You have 2 benefits in breakdown_cover across AA Membership. Review to see if you're using all of them or if consolidation could save money."
```

**After (with new prompt):**
```
Title: "Save £180/year by dropping duplicate breakdown cover"
Rationale: "Your AA Membership and Lloyds Platinum Account both include roadside breakdown cover. Since AA offers superior coverage with home start and nationwide recovery, you can cancel the Lloyds breakdown perk and save £15/month. Log into your Lloyds app and opt-out of breakdown insurance to start saving immediately."
Savings: £180-£200/year
```

### 2. **Better Context & Direction**

The new prompt instructs GPT to:
- ✅ Reference specific membership names (e.g., "Your AA Membership")
- ✅ Include concrete numbers and timeframes ("£180/year", "£15/month")
- ✅ Provide step-by-step actions ("Log into your Lloyds app...")
- ✅ Show urgency ("start saving immediately", "Before renewal")
- ✅ Explain WHY it matters for THEM

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Design**

New recommendation cards feature:
- **Larger, bolder titles** for immediate impact
- **Prominent savings badges** with emoji 💰
- **Color-coded icons** by recommendation type:
  - 🔴 Red = Overlaps/Duplicates (urgent)
  - 🔵 Blue = Unused Perks (opportunity)
  - 🟣 Purple = Better Alternatives (switch)
  - 🟢 Green = Bundles (consolidate)
  - 🟡 Yellow = Quick Wins (easy value)
- **Better labels**: "⚠️ Duplicate", "💎 Unused Perk", "🔄 Better Option"
- **Left border accent** for visual hierarchy
- **Enhanced hover effects** for engagement

### 4. **Improved Prompt Engineering**

The new `RECO_PROMPT` includes:

**Analysis Framework:**
1. Duplicate Detection → Calculate savings
2. Unused Perks → Spot high-value benefits + activation steps
3. Better Alternatives → Compare costs vs. benefits
4. Quick Wins → Time-sensitive, high-return actions

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Conversational tone (use "you" and "your")
- Lead with benefit/saving
- Include specific numbers
- Make it actionable
- Show urgency where relevant

## Example Transformations

### Overlap Detection

**Before:**
> "Duplicate entertainment Benefits - You have 3 benefits in entertainment across Spotify Premium Family."

**After:**
> "Unlock 3 unused streaming perks worth £120/year - Your Spotify Premium Family includes ad-free music, offline downloads, and a personalized Family Mix playlist. You're only using the ad-free feature. Download the Spotify app on your commute devices to use offline listening and save on mobile data (£10/month average). Takes 2 minutes to set up."

### Unused Benefits

**Before:**
> "Unused AA Membership Perk: Home Breakdown - Your AA Membership includes Home Breakdown. Make sure you're taking advantage of this benefit!"

**After:**
> "Activate £80 home emergency cover you're already paying for - Your AA Membership includes Home Breakdown worth £80/year that 73% of members forget to use. If your boiler breaks or pipes freeze, you're covered for callout + first hour labor. Save the AA Home number (0800 ...) in your phone contacts now - you never know when you'll need it."

### Better Alternatives

**Before:**
> (Not detected)

**After:**
> "Switch to Revolut Premium and drop 2 other memberships to save £240/year - Revolut Premium (£7/month) includes travel insurance, airport lounge access, and commission-free trading - replacing your standalone Allianz insurance and Charles Schwab account. You'll save £20/month while getting better foreign exchange rates. Bonus: 5% cashback on Booking.com."
