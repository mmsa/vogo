# Cache & UI Improvements

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. 🧠 AI Recommendations Caching

**Problem:** AI recommendations were being re-fetched every time, causing:
- Slow page loads
- Unnecessary API calls
- Poor user experience when toggling modes

**Solution:** Implemented persistent caching with localStorage
- ✅ AI and Rule-based recommendations cached separately
- ✅ Cache persists across page refreshes
- ✅ AI mode preference remembered
- ✅ Instant switching between modes (no loading when cached)

**How it works:**
```typescript
// On initial load, restore from localStorage
const [aiMode, setAiMode] = useState(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem("vogo_ai_mode");
  return saved === "true";
});

// Cache AI recommendations
localStorage.setItem("vogo_cache_ai", JSON.stringify(aiCache));
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Instant mode switching after first load
- 💰 Reduced OpenAI API costs (fewer calls)
- ⚡ Better UX - no waiting for re-fetching

### 2. 🎯 Enhanced Membership Visibility

**Problem:** Added memberships were not clearly distinguishable from available ones

**Solution:** Multi-layered visual distinction

#### Visual Enhancements:
1. **Badge Overlay:** "Active" badge on top-right corner
2. **Card Background:** Subtle primary color tint
3. **Ring Border:** 2px primary color ring around card
4. **Icon Color:** Filled primary color icon (vs outline)
5. **Footer Message:** "Added to your memberships" text
6. **Animation:** Scale-in animation on the badge

#### Page Organization:
- **Separated Sections:** 
  - "Your Active Memberships" (with count badge)
  - "Available Memberships"
- **Quick Filter:** "My Memberships (X)" badge filter
- **Auto-refresh:** Page reloads after adding memberships

**Before:**
```
isAdded={false} // Hardcoded!
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Track user's actual memberships
const [userMembershipIds, setUserMembershipIds] = useState<number[]>([]);

// Load from API
const userBenefits = await api.getUserBenefits(CURRENT_USER_ID);
const membershipSet = new Set(userBenefits.map(b => b.membership_id));
setUserMembershipIds(Array.from(membershipSet));
```
