=== CHROME WEB STORE PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS ===

Copy and paste these into the Chrome Web Store submission form:

---

storage justification:
The storage permission is required to securely store the user's authentication token and API configuration locally in the browser. This allows the extension to maintain the user's login session without requiring them to authenticate every time they use the extension. We also store user preferences (such as auto-open settings) and cache benefit matching results locally to improve performance and reduce API calls. All stored data is encrypted by Chrome's storage API and never shared with third parties. The storage permission is essential for the extension's core functionality of providing personalized benefit alerts.

---

tabs justification:
The tabs permission is required to automatically detect when the user navigates to a new website and check if relevant membership benefits are available. The extension monitors the active tab's URL when pages finish loading to identify the current website. This enables automatic detection of benefit opportunities without requiring the user to click the extension icon. We only access the URL of the active tab - we do not read page content, track browsing history, or monitor other tabs. The permission is essential for providing proactive benefit alerts as users browse the web.

---

scripting justification:
The scripting permission is required to dynamically inject a content script into the active tab when relevant membership benefits are detected. This content script displays a floating badge notification alerting users to available benefits on the current website. The script is only injected when benefits are found (not on every page) and only affects the currently active tab. The injected script does not read or modify page content - it only displays a notification badge and listens for messages from the extension. This permission is essential for providing visual feedback to users about available benefits.

---

Host permission justification (https://app.vogoplus.app/*):
The host permission for https://app.vogoplus.app/* is required exclusively to communicate with our own secure API backend service. This is our own domain that we own and operate - it is not a third-party service. The extension only sends the current page URL (not page content) to our API endpoint for semantic matching against the user's registered membership benefits. We do not read, modify, or intercept page content on any website. We do not access any websites other than our own API endpoint. All API communication is encrypted via HTTPS and authenticated using secure tokens stored locally. This permission is essential and minimal - we only request access to our own backend service, not any other websites. The extension's core functionality requires this API communication to provide personalized benefit alerts.

=== PRIVACY POLICY DISCLOSURE ===

Add this to your privacy policy:

"This extension collects the URLs of websites you visit to check for relevant membership benefits. URLs are sent to our secure API endpoint (app.vogoplus.app) for semantic matching against your registered benefits. We do not collect page content, browsing history, or any other data. URLs are only used for benefit matching and are not stored or shared with third parties."
